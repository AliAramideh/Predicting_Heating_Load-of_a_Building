# Predicting_Heating_Load-of_a_Building
We have prepared a dataset in the `HeatingLoadOfBulding.csv` file. This dataset is used to estimate the heating load and cooling load of a building based on its parameters.

In 'Predicting Heating Load of a Building using Linear Regression' notebook, I analyzed and modeled our dataset using `LinearRegression()` method from `sklearn` package.

In `Predicting Heating Load of a Building using Linear Regression without sklearn`, I analyzed and modeled our dataset without using `sklearn` package. I useed just the mathematical equations and implemented with python.
